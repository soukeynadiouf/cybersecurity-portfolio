#About Me

**Name:** [Soukeyna Diouf]

**Hometown:** [655 Lakehaven Lane, Loganville GA, 30052]

**Prior IT Experience:**
(I am a certified Apple IOS technician and worked with Apple for a couple of years. Then transitioned into software troubleshooting with the simulcast system with Manheim whenever the users were having video or audio issues. With Mailchimp is was a Tech Support representative also supporting the application with html codes that were broken in the marketing campaign, helped with connecting integration, connecting e-commerce stores using API keys and much more.)

**Career Plans:**
(Of course I want to learn everything there is to know about cybersecurity, and my goals aren't set in stone since there are so many different domains in cybersecurity, I may change my mind but for now I am open to where my strength are. But I was initially interested in being a SOC analyst but now I am open to all of the other possibilities. )

**Proud Project/Task:**
(Working with Manheim I started a project called the error code project. I was in the operations team as a Voice of the client Analyst. I listened to feeback surveys from detractors in order to see how we can improve the operations and the system. One of the biggest pain point was how long it took our agents to solve an issue a dealer is experiencing when they were blocked for any given reason. The website will give the user an error message but it didn't describe the issue, so the agents always had to go on a scavenger hunt to find why the customer was blocked from purchasing, and there were a lot of reasons, from documents of the dealership missing, to non payment, to the auction blocking them for bad behavior, and I mean the list goes on. I asked my self, "if the system knows why a dealer is blocked, then there is a command that is telling it to," so we need to find a way to collaborate with the developers that created those commands. I partnered the UX and developers team in order to find where this information was housed. After it was located, I took on the task of rewriting the error message to include a error code number that dealers can see, however, the agents were given a cheat sheet that included the reason. This allowed the agents to find the probplem a lot faster. So basically when the project was done, calls that used to take 17 minutes on average were resolved in less than 5.)
